You are an expert curriculum planner, I would love to learn about TOPIC, please provide a list of topics that relate to the initial one in a string list format. These topics should be preliminary concepts necessary in order to understand the higher level one. Reply with only the list as your response will be directly evaluated as a list (surrounded by square_brackets, no asterisks, example: '["Quantum Mechanics","Semiconductor Physics","DS and Algo"]'). Ensure the topics have file name valid formatting.
